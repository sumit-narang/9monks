<center><h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2></center>

 <p class="h6">We at 9monks Retail Services Private Limited ("Company", "we", "us","our") know that our users ("you", "your") care about how your personal 
 information is used  and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
 By visiting or using the Website or Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) in any manner, 
 you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, 
 and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
 Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the Company's Terms of Service.
</p>

<p class="h4">1. WHAT INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</p>

<p class="h5">Information You Provide to Us:</p>
<p class="h6">
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect personal information such as your name, email address, 
contact number, bank account and credit/debit card information, browser information and third-party account credentials ("Personal Information").
 Additionally, we may also collect information such as your food preferences, marital status and details about your family, which shall 
 be provided by you on a voluntary basis. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or 
 information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and
 that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain 
 information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal 
 Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you. For example, we may communicate with you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open a message from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more relevant and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us that are not important to the Service, please indicate your preference by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of each email sent to you by us. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal information from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal information for changes.
</p>
<p class="h5">Information Collected Automatically:</p>
<p class="h6">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information from your browser which may include your IP address, 
"cookie" information, and the page you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize
your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. 
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device's acceptance of cookies, 
but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may 
also transmit cookies to you. You hereby agree that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. When we collect usage
information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, 
and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Services, so that
we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; 
our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide
 you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
 </p>
 
<p class="h4">2. WILL WE SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
<p class="h6">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your 
Personal Information with third parties as described below:</p>
<p class="h5">Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</p> 
<p class="h6">
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we are affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through 
the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service,
 and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. 
 One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or 
 to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices
 of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to 
 an affiliated website or business, please review all such business' or websites' policies.
 </p>
 
<p class="h5">Agents:</p> 
<p class="h6">
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or 
services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond 
what is necessary to assist us.
</p>
<p class="h5">User Profiles and Submissions:</p>
<p class="h6"> 
Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user's name and location may be displayed to other users 
to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for Company's services. Your account privacy settings 
allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user 
profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that
 you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.)
 becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users 
 if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you 
 through messages and comments. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service 
 which may interact with our Services.
</p>
<p class="h5">Business Transfers:</p> 
<p class="h6">
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business 
assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, 
or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
</p>
<p class="h5">Protection of Company and Others:</p> 
<p class="h6">
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to 
comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, 
or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations 
for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p class="h5">With Your Consent:</p> 
<p class="h6">
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties in personally identifiable form,
 and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
</p>
<p class="h4">3. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</p>
<p class="h6">
You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some
 of our special features.You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may
 maintain a copy of the un-revised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by emailing us 
 at <a href="mailto:care@9monks.in">care@9monks.in</a> We will delete all of the content contained in your profile; 
 however, please note that some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. 
 We may also keep a copy of any such information for legal archival purposes. We may use any aggregated data derived from or 
 incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
</p>
<p class="h4">4. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p class="h6">
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you 
(for example, by email or a sign-in notification or some other means). By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective,
 you are agreeing to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy; if you do not agree to the change, simply don't use the Service after the change 
 is effective, in which case the change will not apply to you.
</p>

<p class="h4">5. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</p>
<p class="h6">
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message at <a href="mailto:care@9monks.in">care@9monks.in</a>and we will try to resolve your concerns.
